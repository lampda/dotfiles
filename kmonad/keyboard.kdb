                              KMonad: Guided tour




  Welcome to the KMonad configuration tutorial. This document aims to explain:
  1. The configuration syntax
  2. The required information
  3. All possible configuration options

  This document should be a runnable configuration, so with some tweaks to the
  `defcfg` block (see below) you should be able to try out all the examples
  interactively.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |#

                     Basic syntax: comments and parentheses

  KMonad's configuration language is styled on various lisps, like scheme or
  Common Lisp. In a lisp, every statement is entered between '(' and ')'s. If
  you are more used to Fortran style languages (python, ruby, C, Java, etc.), the
  change is quite straightforward: the function name moves into the parentheses,
  and you don't use commas to separate arguments. I.e.

  This:     my_function(a, 3, "Alakazam")
  Becomes:  (my_function a 3 "Alakazam")

  The reason for this is because Lisp-style languages are very easy to parse and
  write syntax-highlighters for.

  We also provide standard Lisp syntax for comments:
  - block comments between: #| and its reverse
  - line comments following: ;;

  Unlike standard lisp, a single ; does not denote a comment, but instead the
  keycode for semicolon.

  Also, as you might have noticed, whitespace is possible anywhere.

  To check for syntax errors while editing, invoke KMonad with the -d option.

                         Necessary: the `defcfg` block

  There are a few bits of information that are required to be present in a
  KMonad configuration file. One of these is the existence of exactly 1 `defcfg`
  statement. This statement is used to customize various configuration settings.
  Many of these settings have default values, but a minimal definition must
  include at least an 'input' field and an 'output' field. These describe how
  KMonad captures its inputs and how it emits its outputs.

  First, let's go over the optional, non-OS specific settings. Currently there
  are only 2:

  - fallthrough: `true` or `false`, defaults to `false`

    KMonad catches input events and tries to match them to various handlers. If
    it cannot match an event to any handler (for example, if it isn't included
    in the corresponding `defsrc` block, or if it is, but the current keymap
    does not map any buttons to it), then the event gets quietly ignored. If
    `fallthrough` is set to `true`, any unhandled events simply get reemitted.

    In more practical terms, this allows you to only specify the keys that
    you want to overwrite in your `defsrc' block. For example, the following
    configuration would rebind Caps Lock to Escape only when tapped.

      (defcfg
        input … output …
        fallthrough true)
      (defsrc caps)
      (deflayer my-layer (tap-next esc caps))

  - allow-cmd: `true` or `false`, defaults to `false`

    If this is set to `false`, any action that runs a shell-command will simply
    log to `stdout` without ever running (log-level info). Don't ever enable
    this on a configuration that you do not trust, because:

      (cmd-button "rm -rf ~/*")

    is a thing. For more information on the `cmd-button' function, see the
    section on Command buttons below.

  - implicit-around: `around` (default), `around-only`, `around-when-alone` or `disabled`

    An implicit around may be in `A` or `_` but also in modded buttons (`S-a`).
    This changes how implicit arounds are handled, for more details see `around`
    below.
    `disabled` results in an error when implicit around is used.

  There are also some optional OS specific settings that we support:

  - `cmp-seq': KEY, defaults to `RightAlt' (Linux X11 specific)

    This sets your compose key for Unicode input. For more information, as well
    as a workaround to also make this work on windows, see the section on
    Compose-key sequences below.

  - `cmp-seq-delay': NUMBER (in milliseconds)

    This sets a delay between each pressed key in a compose-key sequence.  Some
    environments may have troubles recognizing the key sequence if it's pressed
    too rapidly; if you experience any problems in this direction, you can try
    setting this value to `5' or `10' and see if that helps.

  Secondly, let's go over how to specify the `input` and `output` fields of a
  `defcfg` block. This differs between OSes, and so do the capabilities of
  these interfaces.


  -- Linux ------

  In Linux we deal with input by performing an ioctl-grab on a specific
  device-file. This allows us to hook KMonad on the input of exactly 1 keyboard,
  and allows you to run multiple instances of KMonad for different keyboards. We
  make an input using:
    (device-file "/dev/input/by-id/my-keyboard-kbd")

  NOTE: Any valid path to a device-file will work, but it is recommended to use
  the 'by-id' directory, since these names will not change if you replug the
  device.

  We deal with output by creating a 'uinput' device. This requires that the
  'uinput' kernel module is loaded. The easiest way to ensure this is by calling
  'sudo modprobe uinput'. We create a uinput device using:
    (uinput-sink "name" "optional post-init command")


  -- Windows ----

  In Windows we do not get such fine-grained control. We use a low-level
  keyboard hook to intercept all non-injected keyboard events. There is
  currently an open issue to improve the C-bindings used to capture windows
  keyevents, and if you have a better way to approach this issue, help is deeply
  appreciated. You specify a windows input using:
    (low-level-hook)

  Similarly, the output in Windows lacks the fine-grained control. We use the
  SendEvent API to emit key events directly to Windows. Since these are
  'artificial' events we won't end up catching them again by the
  `low-level-hook`. It is very likely that KMonad does not play well with other
  programs that capture keyboard input like AHK. You specify windows output using:
    (send-event-sink)

  Specific to Windows, KMonad also handles key auto-repeat.  Therefore your
  Windows system settings for key repeat delay and key repeat rate will have no
  effect when KMonad is running.  To set the repeat delay and rate from KMonad,
  pass the optional arguments pair to `send-event-sink`:
    (send-event-sink [ <delay> <rate> ])
  where:
    <delay> : how many ms before a key starts repeating
    <rate>  : how many ms between each repeat event
  A value of 500 ms delay and 30 ms rate should mimic the default Windows
  settings pretty well:
    (send-event-sink 500 30)


  -- Mac OS -----

  For Mac questions I suggest filing an issue and tagging @thoelze1, he wrote
  the MacOS API. However, input using:
    (iokit-name "optional product string")

  By default this should grab all keyboards, however if a product string is
  provided, KMonad will only capture those devices that match the provided
  product string. If you would like to provide a product string, you can run
  `make; ./list-keyboards' in c_src/mac to list the product strings of all
  connected keyboards.

  You initialize output on MacOS using:
    (kext)

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |#

(defcfg
  ;; For Linux
  input  (device-file "/dev/input/by-id/usb-BY_Tech_Gaming_Keyboard-event-kbd")
  output (uinput-sink "My KMonad output"
    ;; To understand the importance of the following line, see the section on
    ;; Compose-key sequences at the near-bottom of this file.
    "/run/current-system/sw/bin/sleep 1 && /run/current-system/sw/bin/setxkbmap -option compose:ralt")
  cmp-seq ralt    ;; Set the compose key to `RightAlt'
  cmp-seq-delay 5 ;; 5ms delay between each compose-key sequence press

  ;; For Windows
  ;; input  (low-level-hook)
  ;; output (send-event-sink)

  ;; For MacOS
  ;; input  (iokit-name "my-keyboard-product-string")
  ;; output (kext)

  ;; Comment this if you want unhandled events not to be emitted
  fallthrough true

  ;; Set this to false to disable any command-execution in KMonad
  allow-cmd true

  ;; Set the implicit around to `around`
  implicit-around around

)

                      Necessary: at least 1 `defsrc` block

  It is difficult to explain the `defsrc` block without immediately going into
  `deflayer` blocks as well. Essentially, KMonad maps input-events to various
  internal actions, many of which generate output events. The `defsrc` block
  explains the layout on which we specify our `deflayer`s down the line.

  It is important to realize that the `defsrc` block doesn't *necessarily* have
  to coincide with your actual input keyboard. You can specify a full 100%
  `defsrc` block, but only use a 40% keyboard. This will mean that every
  `deflayer` you specify will also have to match your 100% `defsrc`, and that
  your actual keyboard would be physically unable to trigger about 60% of your
  keymap, but it would be perfectly valid syntax.

  The dual of this (and more useful) is that it is also perfectly valid to only
  specify that part of your keyboard in `defsrc` that you want to remap. If you
  use a 100% keyboard, but don't want to remap the numpad at all you can simply
  leave the numpad out of your `defsrc`, and it should work just fine. In that
  particular case you probably want to set `fallthrough` to `true` in your
  `defcfg` block though.

  There is also support for named `defsrc` blocks. They contain `:name <my-source>`
  as the first argument in their definition.

  The layouting in the `defsrc` block is completely free, whitespace simply gets
  ignored. We strive to provide a name for every keycode that is no longer than
  4 characters, so we find that laying out your keymap in columns of 5 works out
  quite nicely (although wider columns will allow for more informative aliases,
  see below).
  https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad/blob/master/doc/quick-reference.md
  Most keycodes should be obvious. If you are unsure, check
  './src/KMonad/Keyboard/Keycode.hs'. Every Keycode has a name corresponding to
  its Keycode name, but all lower-case and with the 'Key' prefix removed. There
  are also various aliases for Keycodes starting around line 350. If you are
  trying to bind a key and there is not a 4-letter alias, please file an issue,
  or better yet, a pull-request, and it will be added promptly.

  Also, you can consult './keymap/template/' for various input templates to use
  directly or to look up keycodes by position. Here we use the input-template
  for 'us_ansi_60.kbd'
